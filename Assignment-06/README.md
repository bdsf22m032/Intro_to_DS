# Employee Performance and Salary Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an employee performance and salary dataset using Python and Pandas. The goal is to perform various data operations like data cleaning, transformation, filtering, and aggregation to gain insights into employee data.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment
1. **Set Up**: 
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.
   - Perform basic operations to inspect and display the dataset.

2. **Data Operations**: 
   - Perform various tasks including selecting columns, filtering rows, handling missing data, and updating values.
   - Operations like adding new columns (e.g., Bonus), normalizing data, removing duplicates, sorting data, and grouping data for aggregations are required.

3. **Advanced Data Manipulation**:
   - Apply functions like `apply()`, `applymap()`, and merge datasets using joins.
   - Perform calculations like average salary by department, total salary by status, and rank employees by salary.

4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., Performance Score, Salary, Age).
   - Create new columns like "Experience Level" and "Age Group" based on conditions.

5. **Merging Datasets**:
   - Perform merges to combine datasets containing information like Department, Budget, and Team Lead details.

6. **Final Output**:
   - Verify correctness of output for each operation.
   - Save and submit the notebook with clear comments and explanations for each task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas (`pip install pandas`)


## Conclusion
This project covers data analysis, cleaning, and transformation techniques using real-world employee performance and salary data. By the end, you will have performed a variety of operations on the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
