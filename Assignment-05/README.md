# Data Analysis for Retail Company

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer and sales data for a retail company using Python and Pandas. The aim is to extract insights, handle data issues, and perform various data operations such as filtering, cleaning, merging, and aggregating data.

## Tasks
1. **Data Inspection and Preprocessing**: Load datasets, display initial rows, check for missing values, and handle them.
2. **Data Conversion and Filtering**: Convert `customers.csv` into a dictionary and filter by city, then compare efficiency with DataFrame approach.
3. **Duplicate Detection and Removal**: Identify and remove duplicates, verify clean data.
4. **Sales Data Analysis**: Add a discount column and calculate total sales per product.
5. **Filtering Customers by Age**: Filter customers aged 25-35, and analyze by city.
6. **Merging Datasets and Sales Insights**: Merge datasets and find the city with the highest sales and the most sold product.
7. **Further Data Exploration**: Display unique values in `City` and `Product` columns, and calculate mean and median of `Amount`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (`pip install pandas numpy`)

## Submission
- Submit a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) with explanations and comments for each task.

## Conclusion
This project helps practice data analysis, cleaning, and preprocessing using Python and Pandas to generate insights from real-world retail data.
